# SORTING-VISUALIZER- See How Sorting Algorithms Work

Welcome to our Sorting Visualizer, where you can witness the power of sorting algorithms in action!

In this visualizer, you'll see how popular sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and counting sort work, all in real-time.

Simply choose the sorting algorithm you want to visualize and watch as the sorting algorithm processes and reorders the data you provide. You'll see how different algorithms perform under different conditions and the tradeoffs between time complexity and space complexity.

Whether you're a computer science student, a programmer, or just someone who's curious about how algorithms work, this Sorting Visualizer is a fun and educational tool. So sit back, relax, and enjoy watching the magic of sorting algorithms unfold before your eyes.
